## üîß Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fashion-startup-advisor.git
   cd fashion-startup-advisor
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
                   OR
    conda create -p env python=3.10 -y
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:8501)

## üîë Configuration

You'll need to provide your Groq API key in the sidebar when using the application. If you don't have one, you can sign up at [Groq's platform](https://console.groq.com/).

For security, the application never stores your API key permanently - it's only held in the session state while the application is running.

## üí° How It Works

The application uses the Gemma 2 9B Instruct model through Groq's API to generate responses. The system is built on these key components:

1. **Streamlit Frontend**: Provides an intuitive user interface with chat functionality, PDF upload capabilities, and quick-access buttons for common queries.

2. **LangChain Integration**: Utilizes LangChain's ChatGroq implementation to handle communication with the Groq API.

3. **PDF Processing**: When you upload a PDF, the system uses PyPDF2 to extract text content and incorporates it into the AI's context.

4. **Contextual Memory**: The application maintains conversation history within the session to provide coherent, contextually relevant responses.

5. **System Prompt Engineering**: A carefully crafted system prompt ensures the AI responds with fashion industry expertise and maintains a helpful, professional tone.

The advisor is designed to provide guidance across the entire fashion business lifecycle:

- **Ideation Phase**: Brand concept development, market research, target audience definition
- **Production Phase**: Sourcing materials, finding manufacturers, quality control processes
- **Launch Phase**: Marketing strategies, e-commerce setup, pricing models
- **Growth Phase**: Scaling operations, expanding product lines, building customer loyalty
